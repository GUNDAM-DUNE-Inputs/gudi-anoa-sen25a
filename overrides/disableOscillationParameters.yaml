## Disable the oscillation parameters:  Use with

#
# Disable the application of the oscillation parameters.  This is not the
# same as "no oscillations" since the "non-swap" samples are still used.
# This is for debugging application of the "cross section" and "flux"
# against another fitter without involving any of the oscillation weight
# calculation.
